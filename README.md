# Credit_Risk_Analysis
#### *Utilized several machine learning models to predict credit risk using Python's imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries*

## Supervised Machine Learning: Overview of the analysis

The objective of this project was to use machine learning models to analyze credit risk to provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. Using these models, I was able to accurately identify good candidates for loans which could help a financial institution decrease their default rate on their loans. I was able to build and evaluate several machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk.
